### C1 Introduction

<input type="date" value="2022-03-24" />

- Purpose: Present a general view of software engineering
- Software engineering: Application of a systematic, disciplined and measurable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software. ie. the application of engineering to software
  - It's an engineering of abstract things, as the objects it works with are not in the physical world
  - It's more a process of design than that of construction
- Areas of interest
  - Requirements: discovery, analysis, specification, validation and administration of software requirements
    > Requirement : a description of how the system should behave or a property/attribute it should posses
  - Design: Definition of architecture, components and interfaces of a software product.
    > The requirements are analyzed in order to produce a description of the internal structure of the software
  - Construction
  - Testing
  - Management
  - Configuration management
    > Configuration: Group of elements that compose the product/system, combined according to a specific set of procedures
  - Models and methods
  - Processes
- Quality
  - The cost of no quality are bigger than those of quality
  - Quality through testing , verification , etc
- Lifecycle
  - Waterfall
  - Incremental / iterative
    - Rational Unified Process
    - Agile Manifesto
    - Scrum
    - Extreme Programming
    - FDD , DAD , etc

#### C1.1 Quality

##### Definition

[ISO 8402] The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.

##### Verification / Validation

- Verification : Is it well done ?
- Validation : Does it do what it should ?

##### Methodologies

- PDCA ( Plan Do Check Act )
- Six Sigma
- Lean
- TOC ( Theory of Restrictions )

#### C1.2 Models

##### Models

**Model**: Simplified representation _of reality_

- notations are influenced by programming paradigms
- some notations are more biased towards the implementation, other towards the conceptual design / requirements

###### History

- SADT
- IDEF0
- Structured Analysis
- UML

##### UML

###### Diagrams

- Classes
- Use cases
- Sequence
- States
- Activity

##### BPMN

> Business Process Modeling Notation

Usefully to describe processes and automate them

##### C4

- Describes software architecture ( big elements )

- Better for representing architectures than UML ( UML is its last level )

###### Levels

1. Context ( Environment in which the system functions )
2. Containers ( Abstractions ( Apps, Services ) )
3. Components
4. Code ( UML )

##### Utilization

- Simple processes may not need modeling while complex ones would find it essential
