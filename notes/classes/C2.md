The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely **what** to build - Brooks

#### Requirements

> Requisito != Requerimiento

- Definition/s

  - Specification of what is to be implemented. They constitute a description of how the system should behave or a property/attribute it should posses
  - What a product/system should do to meet the users needs and expectations (regardless of implementation)

- Types

  - Functional / Behavioral : what we need the system to do
  - Non Functional / Quality of Service : how we need it to be done - properties / restrictions

- Perspectives
  - business requirements
  - user requirements
  - software requirements

> Requirements engineering helps to translate the needs and expectations of the interested parties and transform them into software requirements.

- Requirement engineering
  - Requirement Development
    - Discovery : determine requirements
    - Analysis : discover and solve conflicts among requirements & env
    - Specification : document
    - Verification : where they correctly described
    - Validation : did we understand them
  - Requirement management : management requirement changes
